- **Intro**

This project is a responive design from a regular computer, tablet and finally a mobile screen resolution. To achieve this I had to use media query's at resolutions of 110px, 760px, and 480px. I also used woff2 fonts that I had to download into the fonts block. The fonts were than implented into the project by using the @font-face element in the fonts.css tab and then they were imported using the @import in the index.css.
